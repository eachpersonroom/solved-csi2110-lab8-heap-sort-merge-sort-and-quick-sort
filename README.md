<h2>Heap Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort</h2>

Download the archive Lab8.zip and extract the TrySorts applet. The applet makes use of the following sorting implementations

<ul>

 <li>BubbleSort.java</li>

 <li>HeapSortInPlace.java</li>

 <li>QuickSortInPlace.java</li>

</ul>

Use the applet wit various setting and observe the behavior. Note, you can have a look at the array before and after sorting for array sizes under 100 elements. The <em>New Elements</em> button will generate a new array to be sorted.

<h2>In-Place Quick Sort</h2>

The quick-sort implementation is not randomized. Randomize the pivot selection and observe any change in running time.

<h2>Merge Sort</h2>

Replace the BubbleSort implementation with MergeSort and compare the sorting algorithm with Quick Sort and Heap Sort.
